####Post Session 12 Homework:
**The following preparation work is strongly recommended, in order to get the most out of class on Monday 4/20**

* Read Paul Graham's [A Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html) and be prepared to **discuss it in class on Monday**. Here are some questions to think about while you read:
    * Should a spam filter optimize for sensitivity or specificity, in Paul's opinion?
    * Before he tried the "statistical approach" to spam filtering, what was his approach?
    * How exactly does his statistical filtering system work?
    * What did Paul say were some of the benefits of the statistical approach?
    * How good was his prediction of the "spam of the future"?
* Below are the foundational topics upon which Monday's class will depend. Please review these materials before class:
    * **Basics of probability:** These [introductory slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cM2dVbJgTWMkHoVNmYlB9df6P2H8BrjaqAcZTaLe9dA/edit#slide=id.gfc3caad2_00) (from the [OpenIntro Statistics textbook](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php)) are quite good and include integrated quizzes. Pay specific attention to these terms: probability, sample space, mutually exclusive, independent.
* Remember that the Midterm Homework 4 is due on Monday 4/20 by 6:00PM!
* Also, you should be working on your project! **Your rough draft is due in less than two weeks!**
